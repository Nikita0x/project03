# First website built with Vue.js + Tailwind.

Original is <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/OfeVmBzq7TJrXvHFxmqpvb/Dananz---Interior-Design-Website-UI-KIT-(Community)-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=1-540&mode=design">here</a>

I tried to follow the mock-up as closely as possible, but adjusted some images which were the same, replaced lorum with meaningful text and sligthly adjusted text color for accessibility purposes. Implemented vue-router as well.
